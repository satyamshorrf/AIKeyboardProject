# AIKeyboardProject
The AI Keyboard Project is a virtual keyboard that uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize hand gestures and movements, allowing users to type on a virtual keyboard without the need for physical hardware. The project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pynput libraries to track hand movements and detect keystrokes.
